## SALES ANALYSIS
The sales spikes observed in late 2014 were largely driven by the **Enterprise and Government segments**. These segments saw a significant increase in sales volume.

•	**Segment Performance**: The highest sales by far came from the **Government segment**, followed by Small Business and Enterprise. The Midmarket and Channel Partners segments showed lower sales contributions.

•	**Product Performance**: The products driving the sales surge were **Montana and Paseo**. This indicates strong demand for these specific products during the period.

•	**Discount Band**: A higher proportion of sales during the spike was associated with a **Low discount band**, suggesting that the increase was not due to heavy discounting but rather strong demand.

•	**Geographic Performance**: The sales spikes were most prominent in **Canada, France, and Germany**.

## PROFITABILITY ANALYSIS
The profitability dashboards highlight significant differences in performance across segments, products, and countries.

•	**Segment Profitability**: The **Government segment** was the most profitable, generating **$11.4 million** in profit. In contrast, the **Enterprise segment** had a **negative profit of -$0.6 million**, indicating that sales in this segment were not profitable and were likely sacrificing profit for volume.

•	**Product Profitability**: **Paseo** was the leading product in terms of profitability. The **Velo and Montana** products, while contributing to sales, were **performing poorly in some countries**, particularly in **Mexico**, where their sales were nearly half of what they were in other countries.

•	**Geographic Profitability**: **Germany, France, and Canada** had the **highest profit margins**, while USA and Mexico had lower margins. This suggests that while **Mexico** may not be a major driver of sales, it is **highly profitable at 14% margin**, compared to the USA which only has a margin of 12%.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
To improve overall profitability, it is recommended to investigate the root causes of the negative profit in the Enterprise segment. Additionally, a deeper analysis into the performance of Velo and Montana in different regions could help uncover strategies to improve their sales and profitability in underperforming markets like Mexico.
